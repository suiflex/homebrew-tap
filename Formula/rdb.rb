# Rendered by .github/workflows/release-build.yml into suiflex/homebrew-tap.
# Placeholders (0.46.0, https://github.com/suiflex/rdb/releases/download/v0.46.0, 3e0d7493af4d206c5a25c7b535437b4a943f0ba84c98383e960c2118b30e7f4a) are filled in via sed on each
# release. Edit the template, not the generated file.
#
# The arm64 stanza carries its own placeholder and a trailing marker comment.
# That leg of the build is best-effort (continue-on-error), so the asset may be
# absent: the workflow strips the marker when it exists and deletes those lines
# outright when it does not. The arm64 placeholder is deliberately not spelled
# out above, because the delete path leaves no sed rule to substitute it and a
# leftover placeholder in this comment would (rightly) fail the render check.

# Linux only. RDB is a GUI app, so macOS installs go through the `rdb` cask
# (rdb-cask.rb.tmpl), which drops RDB.app into /Applications. Homebrew resolves
# a bare `brew install rdb` to the formula, so keeping a macOS formula here
# meant Mac users got the GUI binary dumped on $PATH instead of the app.

  # x86_64 stays the unconditional default and arm64 overrides it, rather than
  # both living in arch blocks. If the best-effort arm64 leg produced nothing,
  # the override lines are deleted and this formula falls back to exactly the
  # x86_64-only shape it had before — whereas an arch-block pair with the arm64
  # half missing leaves an arm machine with no url at all, which Homebrew
  # rejects at *load* time ("formula requires at least a URL"), breaking more
  # than just the install.
